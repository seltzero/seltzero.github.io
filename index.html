				<h2 class="div-title">About Me:</h2>
				<p>I am a rising third-year student studying cybersecurity in Northeastern University's Khoury College of Computer Sciences. My interests lie in the area of infrastructure and its intersection with cyber-warfare and national security.</p>
				<p>Outside of working with computers, I enjoy running with the Northeastern Club Running team, where I am training to hopefully qualify for the Boston Marathon. I also have been playing the piano for 12+ years now and enjoy playing blues, rock, and jazz.</p>
