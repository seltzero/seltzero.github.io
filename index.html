				<h2 class="div-title">About Me:</h2>
				<p>I am a third-year student studying cybersecurity at Northeastern University's Khoury College of Computer Sciences. My interests lie in the area of infrastructure and its intersection with cyber-warfare and national security. I am currently participating in the <a href="https://www.sfs.opm.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CyberCorps&#174;: Scholarship for Service</a> program, run by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, and have committed to working to strengthen the cybersecurity of the US government following my graduation.</p>
				<p>Outside of working with computers, I enjoy running with the Northeastern Club Running team, where I am training to hopefully qualify for the Boston Marathon. I also have been playing the piano for 12+ years now and enjoy playing blues, rock, and jazz, both solo and with groups. When not in school I like traveling to new places and putting my PADI Scuba Diving certification to use.</p>
